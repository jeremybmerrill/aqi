goals:

- display a clock and both AQIs
    - with a progress indicator if the AQI is currently being read
- if you tap an AQI, you get taken to a chart
- if you tap on the chart, you go back to the main screen

- initially, if you tap anything, the bg color changes
- do I need threads to listen for events?!
